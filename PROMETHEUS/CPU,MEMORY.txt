CPU Usage
Query: Monitor CPU utilization of your application.

100 - (avg by (instance) (irate(node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m])) * 100)
Description: Calculates CPU usage percentage across all cores. Adjust [5m] for different time ranges.

Memory Usage
Query: Track memory consumption of your application.

node_memory_MemTotal_bytes - node_memory_MemFree_bytes - node_memory_Buffers_bytes - node_memory_Cached_bytes
Description: Calculates used memory (excluding buffers and cached).

Disk I/O
Query: Monitor disk read/write operations and latency.

rate(node_disk_reads_completed_total[5m])
rate(node_disk_writes_completed_total[5m])
Description: Tracks the rate of completed read and write operations on disks over a 5-minute window.

Network I/O
Query: Track incoming and outgoing network traffic.

sum by (instance) (rate(node_network_receive_bytes_total[5m]))
sum by (instance) (rate(node_network_transmit_bytes_total[5m]))
Description: Sums the rate of incoming and outgoing network traffic (bytes per second) over a 5-minute window for each instance.
